Github repo: [SupernoVAs](https://github.com/uva-cs3240-f19/project-102-supernovas)

## Main Features

As a UVA-affiliated user, you have the ability to log in with your @virginia.edu email, browse listings, add your own, and contact sellers about their listings. Every page requires you to be logged in to protect the safety of the sellers. 

You can either [browse all products](https://uvacraigslist.herokuapp.com/marketplace/) or [filter by various fields](https://uvacraigslist.herokuapp.com/marketplace/advFilter/), such as item name, price, and category. Messaging is also done within the web app.

When adding a new listing, be sure to fill out all the fields. The only field you can leave blank is the item's location, just in case you don't want to post that online. If you do leave it blank, the item will default to the Rotunda.

## Other Quirks and Features
As a seller, you need the ability to mark items as sold, or even delete items. You can do so right from the item's page, or from your [profile page](https://uvacraigslist.herokuapp.com/marketplace/profile/)! 

If you like the kinds of items that someone has posted, check out their posting history by going to their user page (accessible from any of their items' pages).

If someone's [sent you a message](https://uvacraigslist.herokuapp.com/marketplace/inbox/), hit the "reply" button to easily send a message with the receipient and subject already filled out. Their message is also shown above your reply field, so there's no need to go back to see what you're replying to.

As a fun quirk, check out where people are posting items by going to the [map].(https://uvacraigslist.herokuapp.com/marketplace/map/)
